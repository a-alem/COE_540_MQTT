# Course COE 540 Project - MQTT code

This repository holds code used for course COE 540 - Term 241 project.

## Sources

- For the clients, we sourced the code from COE 550 course with a lot of modifications to suite our project
- For the broker, we used the global template for the Python MQTT broker provided by Cisco's Packet Tracer, note that we only added the python files, the remaining files have not been modified and can be easily sourced from packet tracer
